A screening tool leveraging on a brilliant deep learning backed system of algorithms, that would accurately detect malaria parasites from cell images, giving results at an incredible speed!  

The deep learning algorithm studies critically, thousands of images and is able to learn patterns (weights) that exist in these samples via Supervised Learning through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), so that it can accurately predict the presence of Malaria parasites in an image, and hence save lives.

We are combining our unique AI technology with Blockchain technology, to aid with a distributed and secure architecture, that promotes authenticity and integration of the Lab datasets processed by our AI technology.
